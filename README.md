# doorbell_esp32_mqtt_mikrodash_alexa

This repository contains the code for an intelligent doorbell system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller and communicates with IoT devices through the Mikrodash platform and Alexa. The doorbell can be activated through a touch button or a motion sensor, and information is transmitted using the MQTT protocol, making it highly scalable and adaptable to different environments.

In addition to its advanced features, the doorbell is equipped with a security camera that sends a photo of the person who rings the doorbell via Telegram. This makes it a comprehensive security solution for your home.

## Getting Started

To use this system, you'll need an ESP32 microcontroller and a few other hardware components, which are listed in the documentation. You'll also need to configure Mikrodash and Alexa to communicate with the doorbell.

The repository includes the firmware source code for the ESP32, as well as the instructions needed to configure Mikrodash and Alexa. You'll also find the code necessary to integrate Telegram functionality into the system.
